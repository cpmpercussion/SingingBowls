Singing Bowls is an annular interface for performing music on iPads.
Each ring represents a different note that can be tapped to make a
short sound, or swirled to make a continuous sound.

This prototype instrument was used in research with Ensemble Metatone
in 2014 and later superseded by
[PhaseRings](https://github.com/cpmpercussion/PhaseRings) which was
released in the iTunes App Store.

Singing Bowls has a minimal interface and generally relies on
interactions with
[Metatone Classifier](https://github.com/cpmpercussion/MetatoneClassifier),
an ensemble director agent, to function properly.
